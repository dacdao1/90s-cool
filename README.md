# 90's-website-html

I'm re-learning how to create a website with HTML5. Using the basic tutorial on YouTube, I thought about creating a website that would look like one from the 90's / early 2000s. That was a fun time back then, when I first learned about the internet. I usually visit cartoon sites to look at cartoon drawing and playing flash games on those. Now, I'm trying to recreate what I remember from those days. I hope you enjoy the website as much as I enjoy creating it. Peace, out!
