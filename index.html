<p style=font-size:20px>
<font color="#00FFFF">  Click on the link above to head over to Space Jam website. This is a great movie and an all time classis in both sports and pop culture. A great history and battle between the Looney Tunes and aliens that visit Earth from outer space. Far out dude. Most importantly, the magical power and greatness that is Michael Jordan. The man halted his baseball career to help the Looney Tunes achieve their goals of proctecting Earth, by playing 5 on 5 basketball. We all know how great Michael Jordan is at basketball and I can say that he will win not 1, not 2, not 3, not 4 World Series baseball titles for the Chicago Whitesox. Since no one will be call Great of All Time other then Michael Jordan himself.</font></p>

<a href="https://store.ty.com/app/index.cfm" ><h1>BEANIE BABIES</h1></a>
<p style=font-size:20px>
<font color="#00FFFF">
  Beanie babies, that right, the hottest item since those Care Bears and Cabbage Patch Kids in the 80's. You can sell all of your so called <i>valuable items</i> and invest in Beanie Babies. These Beanie will be worth millions, let me repeat that, <blink>MILLIONS</blink>, in the near future. Buy them now before they sell out since there won't be any thing in the future that would worth collecting and saving. These Beanie Babies will worth more then baseball cards and comic books.
